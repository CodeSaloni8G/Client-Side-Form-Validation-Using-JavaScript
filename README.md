# Client-Side Form Validation Using JavaScript

## About the Project
This project is a simple registration form created to practice client-side form validation using JavaScript.
All validations are handled using JavaScript instead of default HTML validation.

## Live Demo
- Link: client-side-form-validation-using-j.vercel.app

## Features
- Validate name, email, password, and confirm password fields
- Display error messages below input fields
- Prevent form submission until all inputs are valid
- Real-time validation using blur events
- Clean and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
- HTML default validation is disabled using `novalidate`
- JavaScript checks each input field using conditions and regular expressions
- Error and success states are shown using CSS classes
- `event.preventDefault()` is used to stop form submission when validation fails

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding client-side validation
- Using regular expressions for email validation
- Improving form user experience
- Writing reusable validation functions
